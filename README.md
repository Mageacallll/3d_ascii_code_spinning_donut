# 3d_ascii_code_spinning_donut
I finished it locally and post it on my git hub now. The logic is not hard to get but the formulas that are used might be hard to work out. 
This program can be seperated to three sections in total:
1. Rotation (not for the first time but for later game loop)
2. Projection (the donut is not 'on the screen' so that we need to project this 3d object on a 2d plane)
3. Display (imagine every element in the display list is a 'pixel' and we need to diplay all the pixels on the screen)
I put lots of explanation to make the code more readable in case :)
